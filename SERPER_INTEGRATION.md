# SerperDevTool Integration in CrewAI Application

## Overview
The SerperDevTool has been successfully integrated into the LatestAiDevelopment CrewAI application as part of the research task. This tool enables the researcher agent to perform web searches and gather real-time information from the internet.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Tool Import
The SerperDevTool is imported from `crewai_tools` in the `crew.py` file:
```python
from crewai_tools import SerperDevTool
```

### 2. Task Integration
The SerperDevTool is added to the `research_task` in the `crew.py` file:
```python
@task
def research_task(self) -> Task:
    tool = SerperDevTool(
        api_key=os.getenv('SERPER_API_KEY', 'YOUR_API_KEY')
    )
    return Task(
        config=self.tasks_config['research_task'],
        tools=[tool]  # Adding SerperDevTool to the task
    )
```

### 3. Task Configuration
The research task description in `config/tasks.yaml` has been updated to specify the use of SerperDevTool:
```yaml
research_task:
  description: >
    Conduct a thorough research about {topic} using the SerperDevTool to search the web.
    Make sure you find any interesting and relevant information given
    the current year is {current_year}.
    Use the web search capabilities to find the latest trends, news, and developments.
  expected_output: >
    A list with 10 bullet points of the most relevant information about {topic}
    with sources and links from your web searches
```

## Configuration

### API Key Setup
The SerperDevTool requires an API key from Serper.dev. The key is configured through the environment variable:
- **Environment Variable**: `SERPER_API_KEY`
- **Location**: `.env` file in the project root

### Usage
When the crew runs, the researcher agent will automatically use the SerperDevTool to:
1. Search the web for information about the specified topic
2. Gather recent and relevant data
3. Include sources and links in the research output

## Running the Application
To run the application with SerperDevTool:
```bash
crewai run
```

The researcher will now leverage web search capabilities to provide more comprehensive and up-to-date information on the given topic.
